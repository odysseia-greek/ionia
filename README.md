## Dataseeders

### Anaximander - Ἀναξίμανδρος

οὐ γὰρ ἐν τοῖς αὐτοῖς ἐκεῖνος ἰχθῦς καὶ ἀνθρώπους, ἀλλ' ἐν ἰχθύσιν ἐγγενέσθαι τὸ πρῶτον ἀνθρώπους ἀποφαίνεται καὶ τραφέντας, ὥσπερ οἱ γαλεοί, καὶ γενομένους ἱκανους ἑαυτοῖς βοηθεῖν ἐκβῆναι τηνικαῦτα καὶ γῆς λαβέσθαι.

He declares that at first human beings arose in the inside of fishes, and after having been reared like sharks, and become capable of protecting themselves, they were finally cast ashore and took to land

Anaximander developed a rudimentary evolutionary explanation for biodiversity in which constant universal powers affected the lives of animals

### Demokritos - Δημόκριτος

νόμωι (γάρ φησι) γλυκὺ καὶ νόμωι πικρόν, νόμωι θερμόν, νόμωι ψυχρόν, νόμωι χροιή, ἐτεῆι δὲ ἄτομα καὶ κενόν

By convention sweet is sweet, bitter is bitter, hot is hot, cold is cold, color is color; but in truth there are only atoms and the void.

Most famous for his theory on atoms, everything can be broken down into smaller parts.

### Herakleitos - Ἡράκλειτος

πάντα ῥεῖ - everything flows

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Raphael_School_of_Athens_Michelangelo.jpg" alt="Parmenides" width="200"/>

Herakleitos is one of the so-called pre-socratics. Philosophers that laid the foundation for the future generations. One of his most famous sayings is "No man ever steps in the same river twice". Meaning everything constantly changes. Compare that to Parmenides. He is said to be a somber man, perhaps best reflected in the School of Athens painting where his likeness is taken from non other than Michelangelo.

### Parmenides - Παρμενίδης

τό γάρ αυτο νοειν έστιν τε καί ειναι - for it is the same thinking and being

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Sanzio_01_Parmenides.jpg" alt="Parmenides" width="200"/>

Parmenides is one of the so-called pre-socratics. Philosophers that laid the foundation for the future generations. One of the key elements in his work is the fact that everything is one never changing thing. Therefor he is a good fit for the dataseeder. Making it like nothing every changed.

### Melissos - Μέλισσος ο Σάμιος

Οὕτως οὖν ἀίδιόν ἐστι καὶ ἄπειρον καὶ ἓν καὶ ὅμοιον πᾶν. - So then it is eternal and infinite and one and all alike.
